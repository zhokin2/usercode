Keep in this dir. "longruns" the root file pieces of many possible runs like Global_258159_1.root... 
- for its futher merging into one root file (for each run), like:

hadd Global_longrunnumber.root Global_longrunnumber_1.root 
Global_longrunnumber_2.root.........Global_longrunnumber_N.root 

However, we have two scripts to facilitate the merging process:
1) stay in main dir.:
/afs/cern.ch/cms/CAF/CMSALCA/ALCA_HCALCALIB/HCALMONITORING/RDMScript/CMSSW_7_4_16_SHIFT/src/RecoHcal/HcalPromptAnalysis/test/SHIFTER_VALIDATION/
2) issue the command 

either(on line pointing of runs to merge):
./glu_runs.csh longruns run1 run2 run2 ... runN

or(use list of runs to merge in file "runlist":
./glu_runs_fromfile.csh longruns runlist

As a result, you'll get the merged root files for all asked runs in this main dir.

3) Copy obtained merged runs (line by line) from main dir. into /eos as like this example:
cmsStage -f Global_259818.root 
/store/group/dpg_hcal/comm_hcal/www/HcalRemoteMonitoring/CMT/histos/Global_259818.root
